# University-of-Surrey-Students-and-Societies-Management-System
This full-stack project involved developing a comprehensive system to manage data for University of Surrey students and societies. The backend was built using NodeJS and connected to a MySQL database, with Laragon facilitating seamless integration. The front-end interface was designed and implemented using HTML and CSS, ensuring a simple yet functional user experience. Key features of the website include the ability to add new students, update existing student information, and perform various searches using advanced filtering options. The entire codebase includes robust validation mechanisms to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the inputted data.
